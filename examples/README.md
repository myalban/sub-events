Examples
--------

Practical examples of creating [SubEvent] from popular hot observables: 

* [from-event] - create [SubEvent] from DOM [Event]
* [from-emitter] - create [SubEvent] from [EventEmitter]
* [from-interval] - create [SubEvent] from a time interval
* [from-timeout] - create [SubEvent] from a time-out

**NOTE:** These are all fully functioning examples, to be copied into your code whenever you need them.
However, these files are excluded from the official distribution, to avoid specific production dependencies
for some of them.

For more examples, see [WiKi] pages.
