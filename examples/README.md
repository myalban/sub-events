Examples

Practical examples of creating [SubEvent] from popular hot observables: 

* [from-event] - create [SubEvent] from DOM [Event]
* [from-emitter] - create [SubEvent] from [EventEmitter]
* [from-interval] - create [SubEvent] from a time interval
* [from-timeout] - create [SubEvent] from a time-out

**NOTE:** These are all fully functioning examples, ready to be copied into your code when you need them.
However, these files are not in the official distribution. See also - [Examples Distribution].
