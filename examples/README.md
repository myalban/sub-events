Examples
--------

Practical examples of creating [SubEvent] from popular hot observables: 

* [from-event] - create [SubEvent] from DOM [Event]
* [from-emitter] - create [SubEvent] from [EventEmitter]
* [from-interval] - create [SubEvent] from a time interval

**NOTE:** These are all fully functioning examples, to be copied into your code whenever you need them.
However, files in this folder are not distributed with the library.

For more examples, see [WiKi] pages.
